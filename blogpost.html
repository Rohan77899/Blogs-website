        A blog (a truncation of "weblog")[1] is an informational website
        published on the World Wide Web consisting of discrete, often informal
        diary-style text entries (posts). Posts are typically displayed in
        reverse chronological order so that the most recent post appears first,
        at the top of the web page. Until 2009, blogs were usually the work of a
        single individual,[citation needed] occasionally of a small group, and
        often covered a single subject or topic. In the 2010s, "multi-author
        blogs" (MABs) emerged, featuring the writing of multiple authors and
        sometimes professionally edited. MABs from newspapers, other media
        outlets, universities, think tanks, advocacy groups, and similar
        institutions account for an increasing quantity of blog traffic. The
        rise of Twitter and other "microblogging" systems helps integrate MABs
        and single-author blogs into the news media. Blog can also be used as a
        verb, meaning to maintain or add content to a blog. The emergence and
        growth of blogs in the late 1990s coincided with the advent of web
        publishing tools that facilitated the posting of content by
        non-technical users who did not have much experience with HTML or
        computer programming. Previously, knowledge of such technologies as HTML
        and File Transfer Protocol had been required to publish content on the
        Web, and early Web users therefore tended to be hackers and computer
        enthusiasts. In the 2010s, the majority are interactive Web 2.0
        websites, allowing visitors to leave online comments, and it is this
        interactivity that distinguishes them from other static websites.[2] In
        that sense, blogging can be seen as a form of social networking service.
        Indeed, bloggers not only produce content to post on their blogs but
        also often build social relations with their readers and other
        bloggers.[3] Blog owners or authors often moderate and filter online
        comments to remove hate speech or other offensive content. There are
        also high-readership blogs which do not allow comments. Many blogs
        provide commentary on a particular subject or topic, ranging from
        philosophy, religion, and arts to science, politics, and sports. Others
        function as more personal online diaries or online brand advertising of
        a particular individual or company. A typical blog combines text,
        digital images, and links to other blogs, web pages, and other media
        related to its topic. Most blogs are primarily textual, although some
        focus on art (art blogs), photographs (photoblogs), videos (video blogs
        or "vlogs"), music (MP3 blogs), and audio (podcasts). In education,
        blogs can be used as instructional resources; these are referred to as
        edublogs. Microblogging is another type of blogging, featuring very
        short posts. 'Blog' and 'blogging' are now loosely used for content
        creation and sharing on social media, especially when the content is
        long-form and one creates and shares content on regular basis. So, one
        could be maintaining a blog on Facebook or blogging on Instagram.
        Blogging is writing about what you like. In other words, writing about
        what you know and providing valuable information to people searching for
        it. A 2022 estimate suggested that there were over 600 million public
        blogs out of more than 1.9 billion websites.[4]
